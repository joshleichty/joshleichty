I write code, debug weird issues, explore how things work, and occasionally share what I've learned. Been around computers since I could reach a keyboard, and I've been making them do interesting things ever since.

Most of my repositories are experimental playgrounds, though occasionally something useful emerges. I appreciate elegant solutions but have a healthy respect for pragmatic hacks that get the job done.

*Let the code speak for itself.*
